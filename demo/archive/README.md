Archived projects (moved from repo root)

This folder contains project directories and files not needed for the published Python SDK development. Items moved here for safekeeping:

- demo
- dev_service
- gateway
- docs
- examples
- top-level web/demo build files like package.json, package-lock.json, vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, index.html
- docker-compose.yml
- node_modules

If you need any of these back, move them out of `archive/` and commit the change.
